                <h2>Welcome</h2>
                <p>This is the starting point of my personal portfolio site where I showcase my projects, skills, and journey as a developer. 
                    Here, youâ€™ll find detailed case studies of my work, including web applications built using modern technologies like MERN stack, 
                    along with other experiments and learning projects.</p>

                <h2>Featured Project</h2>
            <p>My first featured project is an Online Auction System built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). 
                This project allows users to register, log in, create auctions, place bids in real time, and view winners when auctions end. 
                It includes features like image uploads with Cloudinary, email notifications, and a cron job that processes auctions automatically.
            </p>
            <p>
                The goal of this project was to learn full-stack development, improve my understanding of REST APIs, and work with real-time updates. 
                You can explore the source code and documentation on my GitHub once the project is deployed.            </section>
